    <issue
        id="MemberExtensionConflict"
        message="`contains` is defined both as a member in class `kotlin.ranges.IntRange` and an extension in package `kotlin.collections`. The defined behavior for this is to use the member, but since the extension is explicitly imported into this file, there&apos;s a chance that this was not expected. (One common way this happens is for members to be added to a class after code was already written to use an extension)."
