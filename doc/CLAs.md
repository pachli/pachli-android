# Notes on the contributor license agreements

There are two CLAs at the root of the repository.

- `CLA_IC.md` -- for people signing as an individual
- `CLA_ENTITY.md` -- for people signing on behalf of an organisation

They were generated with https://contributoragreements.org/agreement-chooser.html.

CLA signing is managed by https://cla-assistant.io/, which is configured to present `CLA_IC.md` (stored in https://gist.github.com/nikclayton/488f9745d8e2d28fa41a8e674d74eb1a) to new contributors on their first PR.
